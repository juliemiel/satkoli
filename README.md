# Kalaha Game

## Approach
The general approach is to have the game logic in the backend, and only serve a client-side, stateful UI to the end user.

## Tech Stack
I have used a basic Maven Java project for the backend, and simple HTML and CSS for the frontend. I want to bring together these two components using WebSockets.

## Project Structure
The project has two modules, ```backend``` and ```ui``` that are capable of being deployed independently of each other.


## Roadmap
Future enhancement/feature tasks include adding GraphQL support, and an AI assitant for FAQs and Game Know-How.
